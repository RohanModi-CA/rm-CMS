	I get more done when I can hear myself think. When I'm alone, I often reason about schoolwork or projects aloud. Most of the time, I can't do that, and so it's useful to write out my thoughts for a similar effect. This also helps organize thoughts and keep records of everything.

	Recently, I've started using Obsidian (which, I was pleased to find out, is a Canadian company) to take notes in `.md` files.

	I figure that it could be nice to upload some of these notes to my website, by converting the `.md` to static `html` and `css`, which then just gets put onto my private GitHub repository for my website, then served by Cloudflare.

	What we need:
</div>
<div class='post-text'>
	1. A converter between markdown and our HTML/CSS/JS.
</div>
<div class='post-text'>
	2. An interface where we can preview our HTML -- probably just an express app.
</div>
<div class='post-text'>
	3. A tool to deal with the GitHub repository. Likely just calling git commands.
